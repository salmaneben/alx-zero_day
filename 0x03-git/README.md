# 0x03-git

## üìù Description

This directory contains exercises and files for learning Git version control fundamentals as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The project focuses on understanding basic Git operations, file management, and collaborative development workflows.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to explain:
- What is source code management
- What is Git and how it works
- What is GitHub and how to use it
- What is the difference between Git and GitHub
- How to create a repository
- What is a README file and how to write one
- How to write good commit messages
- How to push code to a remote repository
- How to pull updates from a remote repository
- How to work with branches
- How to merge branches
- How to work as collaborators on a project

## üìÅ Files and Directories

### Scripts (bash/)
- **`alx`** - Shell script that echoes "ALX School is so cool!" and "ALX School"
- **`school`** - Shell script that echoes "The school is open!"
- **`98`** - Additional exercise file (placeholder)

### C Files (c/)
- **`c_is_fun.c`** - Basic C programming file (placeholder for future exercises)

### Configuration Files
- **`.gitignore`** - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore (currently ignores `~` files)
- **`up_to_date`** - Contains the Git command used to update the repository (`git pull`)

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Scripts

To execute the shell scripts:

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x bash/alx
chmod +x bash/school

# Run the scripts
./bash/alx
./bash/school
```

### Git Operations

Update your local repository:
```bash
git pull
```

Check repository status:
```bash
git status
```

Add changes:
```bash
git add .
```

Commit changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

Push changes:
```bash
git push
```

## üìã Tasks Completed

- [x] Create repository structure
- [x] Set up basic shell scripts
- [x] Configure .gitignore file
- [x] Create up_to_date file with git pull command
- [x] Implement basic file organization
- [x] Practice Git workflow commands

## üîß Requirements

### General
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- All bash scripts should be executable

### Shell Scripts
- All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All scripts should be exactly two lines long
- The first line should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- All files must be executable

## üéì Project Context

This project is part of:
- **Program**: ALX Software Engineering
- **Track**: Low-level programming & Algorithm
- **Project**: 0x03. Git
- **Author**: Salman Eben

## ü§ù Collaboration

This project supports collaborative development practices:
- Multiple contributors can work on different features
- Proper branching strategy implementation
- Merge conflict resolution practice
- Code review processes

## üìö Resources

**Read or watch:**
- Resources about Git
- About READMEs
- How to write a Git commit message

**Resources for advanced tasks:**
- Learning branching
- Effective pull requests and other good practices for teams using GitHub

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Never push files generated by Emacs to your repository (handled by .gitignore)
- Always pull before pushing to avoid conflicts
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Test your scripts before committing
